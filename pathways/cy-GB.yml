            - **3 Explore** projects: Introduce creators to a set of skills and provide step-by-step instructions to help them develop initial confidence.
            - **2 Design** projects: Allow creators to practise skills from the Explore projects, and express themselves creatively while they grow in independence.
            - **1 Invent** project: Encourages creators to use their skills to create a unique project that meets a project brief for a particular audience.

            ##Quick quiz
            Each project contains a quick quiz with three multiple choice questions. Creators are guided to the correct answer through useful feedback and are awarded a project badge.

            ##Inspiring the community
            Creators are encouraged to inspire others in the Raspberry Pi Foundation community by sharing their Design and Invent projects with us via the [project submissions form](https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/community-project-submissions){:target="_blank"}.

            Mae'r llwybr hwn yn gofyn am lawrlwythiad a gosodiad mawr y dylech ei gwblhau cyn i chi ddechrau'r prosiect cyntaf.

            - Mae angen i chi osod yr Unity Hub a'r Unity Editor ar gyfer eich system weithredu. Gallwch ddarganfod sut i wneud hyn yn ein [Canllaw Unity]( https://projects.raspberrypi.org/cy/projects/unity-guide).
            - Bydd angen golygydd côd arnoch hefyd. Y golygydd a argymhellir yw [Visual Studio]( https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide/3).
            - Bydd angen i chi hefyd lawrlwytho'r [pecyn cychwyn Unity] (https://rpf.io/p/en/explore-a-3d-world-go) o asedau cyn dechrau.

            ## Experience AI Challenge: Music Quest

            This pathway provides the content for young creators to begin their first forays into creating with machine learning and artificial intelligence as part of the Experience AI Challenge.

            The Music Quest takes around five hours of project time to complete and is designed to be flexible in delivery - it can be run as individual sessions or a single-day 'hackathon'. The content also provides the opportunity to continue work on projects between stages.

            The [Mentor Guide for the Quest](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1XGlS9cMlke1-2ZzJYX3Uztezb_gMenIC) contains instructions for creating the needed accounts, running notes for each stage of the Quest, as well as debugging tips and suggestions for extra features creators can add.

            It also contains instructions for submitting your Creators' finished apps to the Experience AI Showcase, to be appreciated and shortlisted by a panel of industry experts and researchers. Shortlisted entrants will be invited to attend our special showcase event, in collaboration with Google Deepmind!
