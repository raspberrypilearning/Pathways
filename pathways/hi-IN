          This path requires a large download and installation which you should complete before you start the first project.

          - You need to install the Unity Hub and the Unity Editor for your operating system. You can find out how to do this in our [Unity guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide){:target="_blank"}.
          - You will also need a code editor. The recommended editor is [Visual Studio](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide/3){:target="_blank"}.
          - You will also need to download the [Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/explore-a-3d-world-go) of assets before starting.

          ##321…Make!
          This path follows [321…Make!](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/321-make-mentor-guide){:target="_blank"}:

          - 3 **Explore** projects to introduce creators to a set of skills and provide step-by-step instructions to help them develop initial confidence.
          - 2 **Design** projects to allow creators to practise the skills they learned in the previous Explore projects, and to express themselves creatively while they grow in independence.
          - 1 **Invent** project where creators use their skills to meet a project brief for a particular audience.

          ##Quick quiz
          Each project contains a quick quiz step. Each quiz contains three multiple choice questions. Creators are guided to the correct answer through useful feedback.

          ##Inspiring the community
          Creators are encouraged to inspire others in the Raspberry Pi Foundation community by sharing their projects with us via the [project submissions form](https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/community-project-submissions){:target="_blank"}. Projects will be anonymously shared to our Community Galleries.
          You can find out how to [share projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide/5){:target="_blank"} in our guide.
