            ## Experience AI Challenge: Music Quest

            This pathway provides the content for young creators to begin their first forays into creating with machine learning and artificial intelligence as part of the Experience AI Challenge.

            The Music Quest takes around five hours of project time to complete and is designed to be flexible in delivery - it can be run as individual sessions or a single-day 'hackathon'. The content also provides the opportunity to continue work on projects between stages.

            The [Mentor Guide for the Quest](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1XGlS9cMlke1-2ZzJYX3Uztezb_gMenIC) contains instructions for creating the needed accounts, running notes for each stage of the Quest, as well as debugging tips and suggestions for extra features creators can add.

            It also contains instructions for submitting your Creators' finished apps to the Experience AI Showcase, to be appreciated and shortlisted by a panel of industry experts and researchers. Shortlisted entrants will be invited to attend our special showcase event, in collaboration with Google Deepmind!
